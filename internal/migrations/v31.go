// V31Migration breaks the segment-recomputation self-loop.
//
// The previous queue_contact_for_segment_recomputation() unconditionally
// upserted into contact_segment_queue whenever any row was inserted into
// contact_timeline. That included rows produced by track_contact_segment_changes
// (kind='segment.joined' / 'segment.left'), which fire as the queue worker
// itself writes contact_segments. The effect was twofold:
//
//  1. Every membership write re-queued the same contact for re-processing
//     after the 15s debounce — pure wasted work.
//  2. The worker's INSERT contact_segments transaction ended up contending
//     with concurrent /opens and delivery-webhook writers on the same
//     (email) row lock in contact_segment_queue. Under broadcast load this
//     stalled the worker for >10s per batch and caused the queue to
//     accumulate without draining.
//
// The function now short-circuits when the timeline event is itself a
// segment membership change, leaving every other event path unchanged.
